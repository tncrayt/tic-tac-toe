## Gameplay

The game starts with two players taking turns to place their marks (X and O) on the grid. The first player to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their marks wins. The game also ends if all cells on the board are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.

## Technical Details

The game is built using React, utilizing components and state management for the game logic. The AI opponent uses a simple algorithm to make strategic moves in single-player mode. CSS styles provide an interactive and visually appealing game board.
